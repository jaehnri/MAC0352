/**
 * Uses mmap to allocate memory space that is shared across all child processes of this broker.
 *
 * Below, the explanation for each flag passed to mmap:
 * 1) NULL: the kernel can place the mapping anywhere it sees fit.
 * 2) size: the number of bytes to be allocated
 * 3) PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE: processes have RW permission on the contents of this array
 * 4) MAP_SHARED: All processes related to this array can access it. MAP_ANONYMOUS: Any other processes
 * have no access to it and it won't be written to any file.
 * 5) File descriptor to be mapped. As we are using MAP_ANONYMOUS, the file descriptor is set to 0, i.e,
 * it won't be written to any specific file descriptor.
 * 6) Offset value. As there is no file descriptor, it will be 0 as well.
 *
